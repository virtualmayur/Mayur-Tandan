I have created a code structure as per the instructions.
Created task wise folders which contains calculate.php file.

To Run these files through command line.
1. Move this folder in PHP directory.
2. Open terminal and go into the PHP directory.
3. Run the files like that ex: "php Mayur-Tandan/task1/calculate.php sum 2,3"
